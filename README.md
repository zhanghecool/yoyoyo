```

We provide compiled CSS and JS (`bootstrap.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`bootstrap.min.*`). [source maps](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/source-maps) (`bootstrap.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools. Bundled JS files (`bootstrap.bundle.js` and minified `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`) include [Popper](https://popper.js.org/).


## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-the-issue-tracker) and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/new).


## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com/>. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Working on our search? Be sure to set `debug: true` in `site/static/docs/4.3/assets/js/src/search.js` file.

### Running documentation locally

1. Run `npm install` to install the Node.js dependencies, including Hugo (the site builder).
2. Run `npm run test` (or a specific npm script) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line.
4. Open `http://localhost:9001/` in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Hugo by reading its [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

### Documentation for previous releases

You can find all our previous releases docs on <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/>.

[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.


## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on development.

Moreover, if your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you must include [relevant unit tests](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/js/tests). All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](https://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

Editor preferences are available in the [editor config](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/.editorconfig) for easy use in common text editors. Read more and download plugins at <https://editorconfig.org/>.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) for changelogs for each release version of Bootstrap. Release announcement posts on [the official Bootstrap blog](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.
